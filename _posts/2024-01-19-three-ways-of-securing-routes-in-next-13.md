### Next.js 13 Secure Routing: Exploring three secure approaches
### **Introduction**
Securing routes is a crucial aspect of web app development, especially when dealing with user authentication. It entails managing access to specific routes based on the user's authentication status. For example, you wouldn't want an unauthenticated user to access an admin dashboard or view sensitive data.

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic knowledge of Next.js, Node.js, and JavaScript
2. Familiarity with package managers like NPM or Yarn
3. A preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
4. Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine

Let's briefly introduce Next.js. Developed by Vercel, Next.js is a React framework designed for building full-stack web applications. It comes with features like file-based system routing, both client-side and server-side rendering, image optimizations, and robust TypeScript support.

To kickstart your Next.js web app project, use the following commands:
